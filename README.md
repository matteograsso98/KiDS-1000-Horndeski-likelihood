# Likelihood code for MontePython for the KiDS-1000 x BOSS analysis of Horndeski gravity (a paper will be published soon) 

Modifying General Relativity on cosmological scales offers a change of perspective on the enigma of dark energy and the fundamental nature of cosmic expansion. We study a remarkable class of modified gravity models, known as Horndeski’s theory of gravity, with a joint analysis of cosmic shear data from ∼ 1000deg2 of the Kilo-Degree Survey collaboration (KiDS), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) measurements of luminous red galaxies. To accommodate such datasets within a modified gravity framework, we extend publicly available likelihood codes. 

Here are the posterior contours - MCMC chains obtained through the likelihood code - for the main cosmological parameters.
